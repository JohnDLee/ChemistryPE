# Chemistry Prompt Engineering for LEF reaction prediction
### by John Lee, Taicheng Guo, Xiangliang Zhang

This research project attempts to utilize prompt engineering to harness the power of LLM for chemistry reaction prediction problems. We limit the scope to only include linear electron flow (LEF) reactions, since the electron flow of such reactions intuitively seems to be decomposable in to a CoT problem.
