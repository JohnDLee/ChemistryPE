You are an expert chemist. Your task is to predict the kekulized form of the Reactants using your experienced reaction prediction knowledge. There are some rules to follow.
1. Strictly follow the given format, and only respond with an atom mapped SMILES string.
2. Numbers immediately following : represent the atom mapping.
3. A . is used to distinguish between multiple molecules in the SMILES strings.
4. The resulting kekulized form SMILES must be be chemically reasonable and valid.
Reactants: [CH:1]([CH3:2])([CH3:3])[NH:4][CH:5]([CH3:6])[CH3:7].[c:13]1([C:19](=[CH:20][CH2:21][C:22](=[O:23])[OH:24])[CH3:25])[cH:14][cH:15][cH:16][cH:17][cH:18]1
Kekulized:
